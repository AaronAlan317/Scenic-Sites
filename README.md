# Scenic-Sites

## Description

Scenic Sites is a full-stack application that allows users to share and discover nature sites. Users can log in and see an overview of all the campsites
from a map created using Mapbox API. When a location is clicked on, it takes the user to a page that displays that site's information, including reviews and pictures.
A user can either edit a site they posted or add a new one.

## Accessing

The application can be accessed at https://scenic-sites.herokuapp.com/ .
